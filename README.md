# Class Structure, Pedagogy and Syllabus
This course is a project-based **introduction to modern JavaScript development**, designed to teach the fundamentals of JavaScript in a **builder-friendly format**. We will focus on the basic structure of JavaScript as a programming language, touching on common libraries to ease development including jQuery and TypeScript, while avoiding teaching any specific opinionated framework such as Angular. Let’s learn the basics first! We will focus on using JavaScript in a variety of contexts, including on the web with Kendo UI, on the backend using Node, on the Internet of Things with Cylon.js, and on mobile using NativeScript. By the end of this course, the student will have moved from having little to no knowledge of JavaScript as a programming language, to having a Github portfolio of web and mobile app projects, experience collaborating with a team, and presenting a project.

**Pre-course preparation**: Write a series of blogposts on Medium on the challenges we face learning a new programming language, or learning a language from scratch, as well as the challenges teachers face in deciding what to teach. Conduct interviews with various well-known educators (Mosh Hamedi, Asim Hussein, Todd Motto, Julie Lerman, Wes Bos, Jesse Warden) to support this series.

**Staffing**: One instructor, for a maximum of 20 students. Several Teaching Assistants would be very valuable for online off-hours help and assistance in the final project


- 6-week session taught over the summer on-campus, (Mass Bay Community College, for example) (June-July)
- Formatted as interactive codelabs - instructor will work through the content in front of the class, then the students will have homework appended to work through on their own
- 2 2-hour-long classes per week, mini-project due at end of each week. 
- Final team project due at end of course after 1 week ‘working period’.
- Showcase session based on team collaboration

**Grading**:
Weekly projects cumulative: 50%
Quizzes: 25%
Final Project and Presentation: 25%
